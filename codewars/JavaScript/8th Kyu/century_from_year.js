// Define a function to determine the century of a given year
function century(year) {
    // Calculate the remainder when the year is divided by 100
    // This tells us if the year is at the end of a century (e.g., 1900) or in the middle of one (e.g., 1901)
    var rem = year % 100;

    // Calculate the base century by dividing the year by 100 and rounding down
    var res = Math.floor(year / 100);

    // If there's a remainder, the year is in the next century
    // e.g., 1901 â†’ 20th century (not 19th)
    if (rem > 0) {
        return res + 1;
    }

    // If no remainder, return the exact century
    // e.g., 2000 â†’ 20th century
    return res;
