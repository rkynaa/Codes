# Primes in numbers (5th Kyu)

# Task description:
#
# Given a positive number n > 1 find the prime factor decomposition of n. 
# The result will be a string with the following form :
# 
# "(p1**n1)(p2**n2)...(pk**nk)"
# 
# with the p(i) in increasing order and n(i) empty if n(i) is 1.
# 
# Example: n = 86240 should return "(2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)"

# Define a function to return the prime factorization of a number `n`
# in a formatted string form, e.g., prime_factors(86240) â†’ "(2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)"

    while n / count != 1:
        # If `count` is a factor of n
        if n % count == 0:

        else:
            count += 1             # Otherwise, check the next integer
