# Easy Diagonal (6th Kyu)

# Task description:
#
# In the drawing below we have a part of the Pascal's triangle, lines are numbered from zero (top). 
# The left diagonal in pale blue with only numbers equal to 1 is diagonal zero, then in dark green (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) is diagonal 1, then in pale green (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21) is diagonal 2 and so on.
# 
# We want to calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients on a given diagonal. 
# The sum on diagonal 0 is 8 (we'll write it S(7, 0), 7 is the number of the line where we start, 0 is the number of the diagonal). 
# In the same way S(7, 1) is 28, S(7, 2) is 56.
# 
# Can you write a program which calculate S(n, p) where n is the line where we start and p is the number of the diagonal?
# 
# The function will take n and p (with always: n > 0, p >= 0, n > p) as parameters and will return the sum.
# 
# Examples:
# 
# diagonal(20, 3) => 5985
# diagonal(20, 4) => 20349
# 
# Hint:
# 
# When following a diagonal from top to bottom have a look at the numbers on the diagonal at its right.

# Define a function to compute the sum of the p-th diagonal in Pascal's Triangle up to row `n`

#   n - the number of rows in Pascal's Triangle to consider
#   p - the diagonal index to sum (0 = left edge, 1 = next diagonal, etc.)
